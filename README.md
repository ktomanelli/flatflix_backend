## How It Works

A user is able to browse available movies separated by category and select individual movies to see information on particular movies as well as watch the trailers for each.

## Built Using?

Flatflix was built with a Rails backend which handles user authentication as well as collection/provision of movie data and trailers. The frontend is built with React which handles neatly displaying the movies of each genre and relevant movie data.

## Software Requirements

- Ruby on Rails
- Node.JS

## How to Run (backend)

- Clone this repo as well as the [frontend repo](https://github.com/dbsk11/flatflix_frontend), navigate to the project root in your terminal.
